**Project: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline POC for Digital Libraries**

- **Objective:** Developed a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the feasibility of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and querying digital library content, combining vector-based retrieval with generative AI for concise and context-aware answers.

- **Workflow:**
  1. **PDF Text Extraction:** Extracted text from PDF documents while checking for duplicates in the vector database.
  2. **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaned and split text into manageable chunks with overlapping windows for better contextual embedding.
  3. **Embedding Generation:** Leveraged "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" to create embeddings for text chunks.
  4. **Vector Database Storage:** Stored embeddings and associated metadata in Milvus for efficient retrieval using cosine similarity.
  5. **Context-Aware Q&A:**
     - Retrieved relevant text chunks from Milvus using a custom retriever.
     - Constructed prompts enriched with metadata for Gemini (Google Generative AI).
     - Generated concise answers tailored to user queries.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Preprocessing:** Python, pandas, custom text processing components.
  - **Vector Database:** Milvus with COSINE similarity for vector search.
  - **Embeddings:** Hugging Face Sentence Transformers.
  - **Generative AI:** Gemini (Google Generative AI).
  - **Frameworks:** LangChain for modular pipeline implementation.

- **Key Achievements:**
  - Validated the feasibility of RAG for querying large-scale digital content.
  - Demonstrated the integration of retrieval and generative capabilities in a seamless workflow.
  - Highlighted potential for scaling to production-grade solutions with minor optimizations.

Here's a polished project description for your insurance article classification project:

**Project: Insurance Article Classification**

- **Objective:** Developed a machine learning-based classification model to determine whether insurance-related articles are "in-scope" (relevant) or "out-of-scope" (irrelevant) for predefined insurance categories and use cases.

- **Key Features:**
  1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
     - Gathered a dataset of insurance articles and performed text cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
     - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.
     - Enhanced dataset diversity with text data augmentation techniques, including synonym replacement and back translation.

  2. **Feature Extraction:**
     - Employed TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Sentence Transformers) to represent text data numerically.
  3. **Model Development:**
     - Trained and optimized multiple machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Transformer-based models) to maximize classification accuracy.
     - Performed extensive hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
  4. **Evaluation and Deployment:**
     - Evaluated the model using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure balanced performance.
     - Designed a workflow for categorizing new articles in real-time or batch processing.

- **Challenges Addressed:**
  - Dealing with ambiguously worded articles that blurred the line between "in-scope" and "out-of-scope."
  - Managing highly imbalanced datasets where out-scope articles were much rarer.
  - Balancing generalization and overfitting during model training due to limited labeled data.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

- **Outcome:** Successfully built a robust classification model that achieved high accuracy and recall in identifying in-scope articles, streamlining the process of content filtering for insurance-related documentation.
